# awesome-sicily

Welcome to **awesome-sicily**,

In Sicily there are a lot of young, innovative and thriving
communities, which sometimes can be hard to find, despite their
relevance. This project is an index of such communities, and also a
way to get involved with them.

## What is on this list

We consider a community **awesome** when it aggregates ideas,
events and talents.
