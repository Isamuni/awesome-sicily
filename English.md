# Awesome Sicily

Welcome on **awesome-sicily**,

In Sicily there are a lot of young, innovative and thriving
communities, which sometimes can be hard to find, despite their
relevance. This wants to be an index of these communities, and also a
way to get involved with them.

## What is on this list

We consider a community **awesome** when it is aggregating ideas,
events and talents. In the English version of the list, communities
welcoming English speakers might get more relevance.
